    <summary>Command line tracing tool for Windows, based on ETW.</summary>
    <description>Wtrace [spelled: wɪtreɪs] is a command-line tool for recording trace events from the Operating System or a group of processes. Wtrace may collect, among others, File I/O operations, Registry operations, and TPC/IP connections. Its purpose is to give you some insights into what is happening in the system.

Additionally, it has various filtering capabilities and may also dump statistics at the end of the trace session. As it's just a standard command-line tool, you may pipe its output to another tool for further processing.

It works on Windows 8.1+ and requires .NET 4.7.2+. Wtrace is just one executable, wtrace.exe, and you may download it from the release page.</description>
